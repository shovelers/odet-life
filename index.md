          <p>Odet Life is a dynamic generative art project based on Conway’s Game of Life</p>
          <p>Game of Life was not the first cellular automata ever
        created. John Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam discovered them in
        1940s and it has been a topic for computer scientist ever since.
        But, Life was the first one to achieve cult status in 1970s. Since then, it has been gateway for generations of
        programmers. People are still discovering new patterns 50 year
        on. Generations have been awestruck with Life’s lesson - How
        simplicity can give birth to such magnificent complexity.</p>
          <p>John Horton Conway - created a zero player simulation game,
        which he called “life” because of its analogies to rise, fall
        and alternations of societies of living organisms. Conway
        designed the rules of the game to ensure unpredictable nature of
        population’s behaviour.</p>
          <p>Grid starts with an initial configuration and then it
          evolves, with three simple rules - iteration by iteration.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Birth: An empty or “dead” cell with precisely three “live”
            neighbours will come to life.</li>
            <li>Death: A live cell with zero or one live neighbours will die of isolation; A live cell with four or more live neighbours will die of overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbours remains alive.</li>
